# Custom Commands
> Do you have a Minecraft server and want your players to get the IP through the "ip" command? Do you want your server members to enter your YouTube channel through the "youtube" command?

The commands listed below can only be used by the server owner, or by persons with the [MANAGE_GUILD\*](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions) permission.

| Command | Function | Example |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ccmd | Base command for configuration and creation of custom commands. | !ccmd |
| !ccmd create command to create a custom command.                                  | !ccmd create ip mc.myawesomeserver.com | |
| !ccmd remove | Command to remove a custom command.                               | !ccmd remove ip |
